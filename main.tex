\section{Introduction}

Critical care medicine requires rapid and accurate risk assessment to optimize patient outcomes and resource allocation. Early identification of patients at high risk for adverse outcomes enables clinicians to implement targeted interventions, adjust treatment intensity, and coordinate appropriate care transitions. This project addresses the fundamental challenge of predicting multiple critical clinical outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting using data collected during the early hospitalization period.

We develop a novel \textbf{Multi-Task GRU Autoencoder with Contrastive Learning} approach to predict three key clinical outcomes: in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay, and 30-day hospital readmission. Our approach advances beyond traditional single-task prediction models by leveraging shared patient representations and multi-modal clinical data to achieve superior performance across all three prediction targets.

\subsection{Clinical Motivation}

Early risk stratification in the ICU is crucial for optimal patient care:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mortality prediction} enables identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from intensive monitoring, aggressive interventions, or timely palliative care discussions
    \item \textbf{Prolonged stay prediction} (length of stay $>$ 7 days) facilitates proactive resource planning, discharge coordination, and family communication
    \item \textbf{Readmission prediction} supports targeted post-discharge interventions to reduce healthcare costs, prevent complications, and improve patient outcomes
\end{itemize}

These outcomes are interconnected and often share underlying clinical risk factors, making multi-task learning particularly well-suited for this domain.

\subsection{Technical Innovation}

Our approach introduces several key innovations over existing ICU prediction models:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Task Architecture}: A shared GRU encoder learns unified patient representations from temporal clinical data, with task-specific classification heads for each outcome
    
    \item \textbf{Contrastive Learning}: SupCon loss with adaptive anchoring ensures that patients with similar clinical outcomes cluster together in the learned latent space, improving representation quality
    
    \item \textbf{Self-Supervised Learning}: An autoencoder reconstruction objective provides robust feature learning from unlabeled temporal patterns
    
    \item \textbf{Advanced Class Balancing}: Smart batch sampling and positives-only contrastive anchoring specifically address the severe class imbalance inherent in clinical prediction tasks
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-Modal Integration}: Comprehensive feature extraction from four clinical data modalities with domain-specific processing and temporal aggregation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Architectural Overview}

Our \textbf{Multi-Task Sequence GRU Autoencoder} (\texttt{MultiTaskSeqGRUAE}) implements a three-loss training system:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} &= \lambda_{\text{recon}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}} + \lambda_{\text{BCE}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{classification}} + \lambda_{\text{SupCon}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}}
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}}$: Masked MSE loss for temporal sequence reconstruction
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{classification}}$: Weighted BCE loss for multi-task outcome prediction
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}}$: SupCon loss with adaptive anchoring for representation learning
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Source and Prediction Framework}

We utilize the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, a comprehensive, freely-available dataset containing de-identified health records of over 40,000 patients from critical care units at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2001-2012). Our analysis focuses on a predefined patient subsample with specific inclusion criteria designed for robust predictive modeling.

The prediction framework implements a structured temporal approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prediction time}: 48 hours after admission ($t = 48h$)
    \item \textbf{Feature window}: Data collected during first 48 hours, aggregated into 6-hour time bins
    \item \textbf{Prediction gap}: 6-hour buffer to prevent data leakage and ensure clinical applicability
    \item \textbf{Minimum stay}: 54 hours required (48h feature window + 6h gap)
    \item \textbf{Target definitions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mortality}: Death during hospitalization or within 30 days of discharge
        \item \textbf{Prolonged stay}: Length of stay exceeding 7 days (168 hours)
        \item \textbf{Readmission}: Hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation and Evaluation}

The project is implemented in Python using modern deep learning frameworks (PyTorch) and clinical data processing libraries. We utilize DuckDB for efficient data access and manipulation, replacing the traditional BigQuery approach for improved accessibility and reproducibility.

Our evaluation framework encompasses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classification Performance}: ROC curves, precision-recall curves, and threshold-independent metrics
    \item \textbf{Calibration Analysis}: Reliability diagrams and calibration error assessment for clinical interpretability
    \item \textbf{Feature Importance}: SHAP analysis for explainable AI and clinical insight generation
    \item \textbf{Deployment Readiness}: Unseen data evaluation pipeline for real-world applicability
\end{itemize}

\section{Data and Cohort Description}

Our analysis utilizes the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database, a large, publicly available dataset containing comprehensive electronic health records from the critical care units of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. MIMIC-III represents one of the most valuable resources for clinical machine learning research, providing detailed, de-identified patient data spanning over a decade of critical care.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cohort Selection and Inclusion Criteria}

To ensure robust predictive modeling and clinical relevance, we implemented strict inclusion criteria for patient selection:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{First Hospital Admissions Only}: Focus on first hospital admissions to avoid bias from readmission patterns and ensure consistent baseline risk assessment
    
    \item \textbf{Minimum Hospitalization Duration}: Patients must have $\geq$ 54 hours of hospitalization data (48-hour feature window + 6-hour prediction gap) to enable meaningful temporal modeling
    
    \item \textbf{ICU Chart Events Availability}: Presence of chartevents data to ensure comprehensive vital signs and clinical monitoring information
    
    \item \textbf{Complete Temporal Coverage}: Sufficient data coverage during the critical first 48 hours of admission for reliable feature extraction
