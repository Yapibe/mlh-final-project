\section{Introduction}

Critical care medicine requires rapid and accurate risk assessment to optimize patient outcomes and resource allocation. Early identification of patients at high risk for adverse outcomes enables clinicians to implement targeted interventions, adjust treatment intensity, and coordinate appropriate care transitions. This project addresses the fundamental challenge of predicting multiple critical clinical outcomes in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting using data collected during the early hospitalization period.

We develop a \textbf{Multi-Task GRU Autoencoder with Contrastive Learning} approach to predict three key clinical outcomes: in-hospital mortality, prolonged length of stay, and 30-day hospital readmission. Our approach extends traditional single-task prediction models by leveraging shared patient representations and multi-modal clinical data across all three prediction targets.

\subsection{Clinical Motivation}

Early risk stratification in the ICU is crucial for optimal patient care:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mortality prediction} enables identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from intensive monitoring, aggressive interventions, or timely palliative care discussions
    \item \textbf{Prolonged stay prediction} (length of stay $>$ 7 days) facilitates proactive resource planning, discharge coordination, and family communication
    \item \textbf{Readmission prediction} supports targeted post-discharge interventions to reduce healthcare costs, prevent complications, and improve patient outcomes
\end{itemize}

These outcomes are interconnected and often share underlying clinical risk factors, making multi-task learning particularly well-suited for this domain.

\subsection{Technical Innovation}

Our approach incorporates several techniques for ICU outcome prediction:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Multi-Task Architecture}: A shared GRU encoder learns patient representations from temporal clinical data, with task-specific classification heads for each outcome
    
    \item \textbf{Contrastive Learning}: SupCon loss with adaptive anchoring to cluster patients with similar clinical outcomes in the learned latent space
    
    \item \textbf{Self-Supervised Learning}: An autoencoder reconstruction objective for learning from temporal patterns
    
    \item \textbf{Class Balancing}: Batch sampling and contrastive anchoring methods to address class imbalance in clinical prediction tasks
    
    \item \textbf{Multi-Modal Integration}: Feature extraction from four clinical data modalities with temporal aggregation
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Architectural Overview}

The \textbf{Multi-Task Sequence GRU Autoencoder} uses a three-loss training system:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} &= \lambda_{\text{recon}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}} + \lambda_{\text{BCE}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{classification}} + \lambda_{\text{SupCon}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}}
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{reconstruction}}$: Masked MSE loss for temporal sequence reconstruction
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{classification}}$: Weighted BCE loss for multi-task outcome prediction
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}}$: SupCon loss with adaptive anchoring for representation learning
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Source and Prediction Framework}

We utilize the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database, a comprehensive, freely-available dataset containing de-identified health records of over 40,000 patients from critical care units at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (2001-2012). Our analysis focuses on a predefined patient subsample with specific inclusion criteria designed for robust predictive modeling.

The prediction framework implements a structured temporal approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Prediction time}: 48 hours after admission ($t = 48h$)
    \item \textbf{Feature window}: Data collected during first 48 hours, aggregated into 6-hour time bins
    \item \textbf{Prediction gap}: 6-hour buffer to prevent data leakage and ensure clinical applicability
    \item \textbf{Minimum stay}: 54 hours required (48h feature window + 6h gap)
    \item \textbf{Target definitions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Mortality}: Death during hospitalization or within 30 days of discharge
        \item \textbf{Prolonged stay}: Length of stay exceeding 7 days (168 hours)
        \item \textbf{Readmission}: Hospital readmission within 30 days of discharge
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation and Evaluation}

The project uses deep learning frameworks for model implementation and clinical data processing.

Our evaluation framework encompasses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classification Performance}: ROC curves, precision-recall curves, and threshold-independent metrics
    \item \textbf{Calibration Analysis}: Reliability diagrams and calibration error assessment for clinical interpretability
    \item \textbf{Feature Importance}: SHAP analysis for explainable AI and clinical insight generation
    \item \textbf{Deployment Readiness}: Unseen data evaluation pipeline for real-world applicability
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Class Imbalance and Modeling Challenges}

Our dataset exhibits significant class imbalance characteristic of clinical prediction tasks, which directly motivates our advanced multi-task learning approach with contrastive learning:

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Final Cohort:} 27,636 patients meeting all inclusion criteria from the initial MIMIC-III population.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing Pipeline}

\subsubsection{Temporal Aggregation}
Clinical data was processed using a structured temporal framework:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Binning}: 48-hour observation period divided into 6-hour bins (8 total bins)
    \item \textbf{Statistical Aggregation}: For each feature and time bin, computed mean, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation
    \item \textbf{Sequence Padding}: Variable-length patient timelines padded to maximum sequence length with masking
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Medication Patterns}: Binary usage flags, dose tracking, and novel drug introduction markers
    \item \textbf{Microbiology Encoding}: Culture site classification, organism identification, and resistance patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Missing Data Handling}

    \item \textbf{Baseline Imputation}: Patient-specific first-day values for laboratory parameters
    \item \textbf{Zero Fill}: Medications and microbiology (absence = not administered/negative)
    \item \textbf{Physiological Constraints}: Range validation using clinical metadata
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Partitioning}
Patient-level splitting prevented data leakage:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Training Set}: 60\% of patients for model training
    \item \textbf{Validation Set}: 20\% of patients for hyperparameter tuning
    \item \textbf{Test Set}: 20\% of patients for final evaluation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Architecture}

\subsubsection{Multi-Task GRU Autoencoder}
The core architecture consists of three main components:

\textbf{Encoder (GRU-based):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bidirectional GRU processes temporal sequences of clinical features
    \item Hidden dimension: 128 units, single layer with dropout (0.1)
    \item Maps variable-length sequences to fixed-size latent representations ($z \in \mathbb{R}^{64}$)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Decoder (Reconstruction):}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GRU decoder reconstructs original temporal sequences from latent representations
    \item Hidden dimension: 128 units, trained with masked MSE loss
    \item Provides self-supervised learning signal for robust feature learning
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Multi-Task Heads:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Three separate linear classifiers ($\mathbb{R}^{64} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^1$) for each outcome
    \item Shared latent representation $z$ fed to all task-specific heads
    \item Binary classification with sigmoid activation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Contrastive Learning Component}
A projection head enables contrastive learning:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two-layer MLP: $64 \rightarrow 32 \rightarrow 32$ with ReLU activation
    \item L2 normalization of projected embeddings
    \item SupCon loss with adaptive anchoring strategy
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Training Objective}
The total loss combines three components:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}} &= \lambda_{\text{recon}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{MSE}} + \lambda_{\text{BCE}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{classification}} + \lambda_{\text{SupCon}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}}
\end{align}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{MSE}}$: Masked mean squared error for sequence reconstruction
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{classification}}$: Weighted binary cross-entropy for each task
    \item $\mathcal{L}_{\text{contrastive}}$: Supervised contrastive loss with temperature scaling ($\tau = 0.2$)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Class Imbalance Handling}
Multiple strategies addressed severe class imbalance:

\textbf{Balanced Sampling:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Custom batch sampler ensuring at least 4 positive examples per task per batch
    \item Oversampling with replacement for rare positive cases
    \item Batch size: 64 patients
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Adaptive Contrastive Anchoring:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Positives-only" anchoring for rare targets (mortality, readmission)
    \item Standard "both" anchoring for balanced target (prolonged stay)
    \item Task-specific weighting based on prevalence rates
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Loss Weighting:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Class weights inversely proportional to target prevalence
    \item Task-specific BCE loss weighting: mortality (8.5), readmission (25.6), prolonged stay (1.0)
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Model Performance}

The Multi-Task GRU Autoencoder with Contrastive Learning was trained for 20 epochs using the training parameters specified in Section \ref{methods}. The model demonstrated strong predictive performance across all three clinical outcomes, with particular improvements observed when using proper temporal masking compared to baseline approaches.

\subsubsection{Training Configuration}

The final model was trained with the following hyperparameters:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Architecture}: GRU encoder/decoder with 128 hidden units, 64-dimensional latent space

    \item \textbf{Batch sampling}: 6 positive examples per task per batch (64 total batch size)
    \item \textbf{Loss weights}: $\lambda_{\text{recon}} = 0.2$, $\lambda_{\text{BCE}} = 1.0$, $\lambda_{\text{SupCon}} = 2.0$
    \item \textbf{Class weights}: [1, 7, 24] for prolonged stay, mortality, and readmission respectively
    \item \textbf{Temperature}: $\tau = 0.07$ for contrastive learning
    \item \textbf{Learning rates}: 1e-3 for most components, 1e-4 for readmission head
    \item \textbf{Warmup}: 1 epoch reconstruction-only training
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Predictive Performance Metrics}

The model achieved strong discriminative performance across all three prediction tasks:

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Clinical Outcome} & \textbf{ROC-AUC} & \textbf{PR-AUC} & \textbf{Prevalence} \\
\midrule
Prolonged Stay (>7 days) & 0.8345 & 0.4032 & 50.2\% \\

& Readmission & 0.5715 & 0.0722 & -- \\
\midrule
\multirow{3}{*}{Real Masks (proper)} & Prolonged Stay & 0.8345 & 0.4032 & +0.0074 \\
& Mortality & 0.7799 & 0.7716 & -0.0047 \\
& Readmission & 0.6379 & 0.0827 & +0.0664 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Performance comparison between dummy masking (treating all timesteps as valid) and proper temporal masking (distinguishing real data from padding).}
\label{tab:masking_comparison}
\end{table}

The most significant improvement was observed for readmission prediction (+6.64\% ROC-AUC), demonstrating the importance of proper temporal modeling for complex, rare clinical outcomes.
